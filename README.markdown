Turing Alarm for Arduino
---------------

The arduino turing alarm is an adaptation of Nick Johnsons PIC-based one. At the time, I found that the PIC chip he used was a little too advanced for me, so I decided to use the Arduino microcontroller. All credits for the idea goes to Nick.  
The turing alarm forces you to solve math problems when you wake up. If you get the math problem correct, the alarm stops, and if you don’t, you will have to solve another one. My version also includes a 12V light dimmer for the strip lights above my bed. A DS1307 real time clock (RTC) keeps track of the time and the menus are controlled with five buttons.
 

###File directories:
- bin - contains .pde arduino files
- doc - contains laser files, dimensions, schematic, pcb design, and fritzing files 

###Future improvements:
- Joystick control
- Math problem level setting
- battery backup power
- two alarms
